# Convolutional Encoders and Viterbi Decoder

Work related to the unit: CCE5101 - Information Theory and Coding


There is also a report related to this work, which describes
* the Convolutional Encoders
* how the channel is simulated to introduce noise, and therefore allow the observation of any errors in decoding
* the Viterbi Decoder, which can perform both hard and soft decision decoding
* bit error rate plots
* possible improvements to the system
